   It also invloves breaking down the project into smaller, manageable components to facilitate accurate cost tracking and control.
2. Agile Methodologies: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, promote iterative development and continuous feedback, which can help control costs by allowing for
   adjustments based on real-time data.
3. Accurate Estimation and Budgeting: This can be done by thoroughly analyzing project requirements and developing a realistic budget based on historical data, industry
   benchmarks, and expert opinions.
4. Continuous Monitoring and Tracking: his can be done through systems such as implementing a system to track actual costs against the budget regularly and use project
   management tools and software to monitor expenses, identify variances, and generate reports.
5. Risk Management: Identifying and analyzing potential risks that could impact the project budget and developing mitigation strategies to minimize the likelihood and
   impact of these risks.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile methodology is an interactive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change while the waterfall framework involves a linear and systematic approach where each phase of the project is completed before moving to the next. The waterfall technique involves limited customer collaboration while the agile technique invloves continuous collaboration. Both of them, however emphasize on proper documentation.

Advantages of Agile Methodlogy
1. Flexibility and Adaptability: Easily accommodates changes in requirements throughout the project.
2. Early and Frequent Feedback: Continuous customer involvement ensures that the product meets their needs.
3. Faster Time to Market: Iterative development allows for the delivery of working software in shorter cycles.

4. Software Development: Agile is widely used in software development, particularly for web and mobile applications, where rapid iteration and user feedback are essential.   
5. Innovative Projects: When developing new products or exploring uncharted territory, Agile's flexibility allows for experimentation and adaptation.

Waterfall methodology on the other hand is beneficial in projects that;
1. Projects with Well-Defined Requirements: If the project's requirements are clear, stable, and unlikely to change, Waterfall's structured approach can be efficient.   
2. Projects with Strict Regulatory Requirements: Industries such as aerospace, defense, and pharmaceuticals often require strict adherence to regulatory standards, making Waterfall's thorough documentation and sequential approach suitable.   
3. Projects with Predictable Outcomes: If the project's outcomes are predictable and the risks are low, Waterfall can provide a stable and reliable process.

Waterfall methodology can be used, for example, in developing a software that would help in translation in an active communication setup between people speaking different langages. Since the function of this software will in most cases remain the same, waterfall methodology would suffice. Agile methodologies can be used, for example, in the development of streaming software. Users of such software usually change their preferences which would necessitate regular iterations during and even after the development phase.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1. Code Reviews: Conducting regular code reviews to identify and address potential defects, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to coding standards and the use of
